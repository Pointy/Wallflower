        Wallflower is a jQuery plugin designed to be a focal
        point for the organization of page behavior (I like
        the word "feature") initialization. As such, there
        are two aspects to using wallflower:
        <ol>
          <li>Feature code must be introduced to the plugin
          via a registration API. A feature is really just a
          piece of code to be called and a minor amount of
          additional information.
          </li>
          <li>Wallflower is invoked in order to apply registered
          features to pages at page "ready" time, or to page
          fragments fetched via a jQuery AJAX API, or even to page
          fragments synthesized by some client-side templating
          framework.
          </li>
        </ol>
        </section>
        <section id='registration'>
          <h1>Registration</h1>
          Feature registration is performed through a jQuery "global"
          function.
          The idea behind feature registration is to provide the
          plugin with information about how to identify page
          elements (that is, elements in the HTML of a page to
          which some features are to be applied), how to extract
          feature parameters from the elements, and then finally
          what code to call when such elements are actually found
          on a particular page.
          <p>
          The registration API can be invoked in different ways:
          </p>
          <code>
            $.wallflower('feature-name');
            $.wallflower('feature-name', function(params) { ... });
            $.wallflower('feature-name', defaults, function(params) { ... });
            $.wallflower(configuration);
          </code>
          <ol>
            <li id='registration-option-1'>
              The first and simplest invocation mode registers
              a feature and assumes that the feature handler
              is an established jQuery method of the same name.
              For example,
              <code>
                $.wallflower('datepicker');
              </code>
              would register the jQuery UI "datepicker" widget.
              Similarly, wallflower assumes that page elements
              to be located and passed to the feature handler
              can be identified by checking the "class" for
              the presence of the feature name:
              <code>
                &lt;input type='text' class='datepicker'&gt;
              </code>
            </li>
            <li id='registration-option-2'>
              The second invocation method associates a feature name
              with the given handler function. Again, wallflower 
              assumes that page elements are to be found by class
              name. The "params" passed to the handler will be those
              found by wallflower's
              <a href='#parameter-discovery'>standard means of discovery.</a>
              (See also the discussion below of the <a href='#config-option-handler'>"handler"</a>
              configuration option.)
            </li>
            <li id='registration-option-3'>
              The third invocation method is similar to the
              second, and also allows a block of registration
              parameters to be passed. The second parameter
              should be an object with any/all of the following
              properties:
              <dl>
                <dt id='config-option-handler'>handler</dt>
                <dd>
                  The handler function for the feature.  Handler
                  functions are passed parameters in the form of
                  a single object. The object property names
                  reflect names of parameters supplied to wallflower
                  as defaults at registration time, or found
                  <a href='#parameter-discovery'>embedded in HTML markup</a>
                  on elements matching the
                  <a href='#config-option-selector'>selector</a>
                  for the feature, or passed as
                  <a href='#feature-application'>application-time overrides</a>
                  to wallflower.
                  The handlers are invoked separately for each
                  DOM element found, such that the "this" context
                  reference will be a jQuery object containing one
                  such DOM element per invocation.
                  (In this way, handler functions can be simple
                  references to members of the "jQuery.fn" object,
                  because their invocation by wallflower mimics
                  ordinary invocation via plain jQuery calls.)
                </dd>
                <dt id='config-option-defaults'>defaults</dt>
                <dd>
                  An object to be used as a source of default
                  parameter values. These values may be overridden
                  by parameters
                  <a href='#parameter-discovery'>embedded in HTML markup</a>
                  and by parameters supplied to wallflower at feature
                  application time.
                </dd>
                <dt id='config-option-selector'>selector</dt>
                <dd>
                  A CSS/jQuery selector string to be used to locate
                  page elements for the feature.
                  The default value for "selector" is "." followed by
                  the feature name, meaning that wallflower assumes
                  that the feature name will appear in the class of
                  elements to be affected.
                </dd>
                <dt id='config-option-attribute'>attribute</dt>
                <dd>
                  Names the DOM attribute to be checked by wallflower
                  when
                  <a href='#parameter-discovery'>checking matching elements for feature parameters</a>.
                  By default,
                  wallflower checks elements for a "data-wf" attribute.
                  (It is not mandatory that elements have the attribute
                  named here, nor the default "data-wf" attribute.)
                </dd>
                <dt id='config-option-evalAttr'>evalAttr</dt>
                <dd>
                  A boolean flag indicating whether the contents of 
                  the "data-wf" attribute (or the attribute identified
                  by the
                  <a href='#config-option-attribute'>"attribute" configuration parameter</a>)
                  should be interpreted
                  as a JSON-notation object, or as a plain string.
                  If true, the attribute value (if any) will be parsed
                  as JSON, and the result used as an object full of
                  parameters to pass to the feature. If false, the
                  attribute value is used plain, with the attribute
                  name used as the parameter name upon feature
                  invocation. (If the attribute name starts with
                  "data-", wallflower strips that for use as the
                  application-time feature parameter.)
                </dd>
                <dt id='config-option-depends'>depends</dt>
                <dd>
                  A list (array) of one or more other wallflower feature
                  names, indicating that the feature being registered
                  should be applied to pages only <i>after</i> the named
                  features are applied. Wallflower imposes an ordering
                  on feature application based on these dependency
                  declarations, but it does not treat missing dependencies
                  as an error condition.
                </dd>
                <dt id='config-option-group'>group</dt>
                <dd>
                  Provides a group association for the feature.
                  At
                  <a href='#feature-application'>feature application time</a>,
                  features can be selected by group name.
                  No default group name is synthesized by wallflower.
                </dd>
              </dl>
            </li>
            <li id='registration-option-4'>
              The fourth and last invocation scheme allows many features
              to be registered one call.
              The configuration object should be of the form:
              <code>
                {
                  'feature-name': { <i>config params</i> },
                  'feature-name': { <i>config params</i> },
                  ...
                }
              </code>
              Each block of "config params" should be as per the description
              given with <a href='#registration-option-3'>registration method 3</a>
              above.
            </li>
          </ol>
          In all cases, calls to the registration function return a list of
          zero or more "overridden" features. In other words, if you register
          a feature called "myfeature" and then register another one with the
          same name, the return value will be an object with the original
          "myfeature" details.
        </section>
        <section id='feature-application'>
          <h1>Feature Application</h1>
          The registration of features with wallflower does not in itself
          cause any actions to be taken outside of the plugin's internal
          book-keeping mechanism.
          In order to activate the registered features, wallflower should
          be invoked as a jQuery method on some target set of DOM elements.
          For example, to cause all registered wallflower features to be
          applied to the entire page, the following jQuery construct could
          be used:
          <code>
            $(function() {
              $('body').wallflower();
            });
          </code>
          The features need not be applied to the entire page, of course;
          wallflower operates on whatever DOM elements are presented to it.
          <p>
          What wallflower does, for each target element, is to find elements
          matching the <a href='#config-option-selector'>configured selectors</a>
          of each registered feature. (Features are processed in an order that
          satisfies the <a href='#config-option-depends'>dependencies</a> declared
          at configuration time, if any.) Those elements are looked for only 
          beneath the target elements in the jQuery object from which the plugin
          is invoked. In other words, in the following:
          </p>
          <code>
            $('#help-form fieldset.question').wallflower();
          </code>
          <p>
          the plugin would look for elements only in <em>fieldset</em> elements
          located inside an element with id "help-form".
          </p><p>
          As elements are located for each feature being processed, wallflower
          <a href='#parameter-discovery'>discovers embedded parameters</a>
          in the DOM and extracts them.
          Those parameters are used to extend a copy of the default parameters
          supplied at <a href='#registration'>registration time.</a>
          </p><p>
          The wallflower plugin also accepts a parameter object when it is
          invoked for feature application.
          The form of this parameter object is, generally:
          <code>
            {
              'feature-A': {
                'parameter-name': 'value', ...
              },
              
              'feature-B': false,  // or true

              '.group-A': {
                'parameter-name': 'value', ...
              },

              '.group-B': false,  // or true

              '*': {
                'parameter-name': 'value', ...
              },

              '*': false  // or true
            }
          </code>
          <dl>
            <dt>Feature name, with parameters</dt>
            <dd>
              The given set of parameters are used as overrides for
              parameters discovered in the DOM and parameters from
              registration-time defaults.
              In addition, the presence of a parameter object ensures
              that a feature will be processed during an invocation 
              of wallflower even if it would otherwise be disabled by
              a group or universal disable flag.
            </dd>
            <dt>Feature name and boolean</dt>
            <dd>
              If the boolean is <em>false</em>, then wallflower will
              skip the named feature for this invocation. If the
              boolean is <em>true</em>, then the feature will be processed
              even if it would otherwise be disabled at the group-level
              or universally.
            </dd>
            <dt>Group name, with parameters</dt>
            <dd>
              The given set of parameters are used as overrides for
              all features
              <a href='#config-option-group'>configued as members of the group</a>.
              Note that the group name must be preceded by a period (like "class"
              references in jQuery selectors).
              The presence of group parameters overrides the universal
              disable flag as well.
            </dd>
            <dt>Group name and boolean</dt>
            <dd>
              If the boolean is <em>false</em>, then all features configued
              in the given group are skipped for this invocation of the plugin.
              If the boolean is <em>true</em>, then the features are not
              skipped even with the universal disable flag.
            </dd>
            <dt>Asterisk, with parameters</dt>
            <dd>
              The given set of parameters is used as overrides for all
              processed features.
            </dd>
            <dt>Asterisk and boolean</dt>
            <dd>
              All features are disabled except those explicitly enabled.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          Wallflower composes the final set of parameters supplied to a
          feature's handler function from the following sources, in this
          order:
          <ol>
            <li><a href='#config-option-defaults'>configuration defaults</a></li>
            <li><a href='#parameter-discovery'>discovered parameters</a></li>
            <li>parameters supplied at wallflower invocation time under the "*" property</li>
            <li>parameters supplied at wallflower invocation time under the group name</li>
            <li>parameters supplied at wallflower invocation time under the feature name</li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section id='parameter-discovery'>
          <h1>Parameter Discovery</h1>
          When, by using the <a href='#config-option-selector'>selector string</a> configured
          for a registered feature, wallflower locates an element in the DOM that should be
          processed by the feature's <a href='#config-option-handler'>handler</a>,
          the plugin first examines the element for the presence of embedded
          parameters.
          Wallflower uses the
          <a href='http://plugins.jquery.com/project/metadata' target='_blank'>Metadata</a>
          plugin to handle parameter values in most cases.
          (The plugin is embedded in the wallflower source, so you don't have to worry about
          it. On the other hand, if you're already using the Metadata plugin, you can 
          source wallflower after Metadata and it'll notice that Metadata is already installed.)
          <p>
          Parameters can be incorporated into HTML markup in three ways:
          <ol>
            <li>In the "class" attribute</li>
            <li>In an element attribute other than "class"</li>
            <li>In a child <em>script</em> element</li>
          </ol>
          Wallflower always checks all sources of parameters, but there's no particular
          requirement that an affected element involve any embedded parameters at all.
          <dl>
            <dt>The "class" attribute</dt>
            <dd>
              In order to incorporate parameters in the "class" attribute value,
              the names and values should be written in JSON notation, surrounded
              by curly braces:
              <code>
                &lt;input type='text' class='datepicker { minDate: 0, maxDate: 90 }'&gt;
              </code>
              Any numbers of parameters may be included between the curly braces.
              <p>
              If two or more features may collide over a given element, then
              the parameters can be qualified by feature name:
              </p>
              <code>
                &lt;input
                  type='text'
                  class='datepicker { datepicker: { minDate: 0, maxDate: 90 } }'
                &gt;

              of affected elements, or the "data-wf" attribute if no attribute is explicitly
              named in the feature configuration.
              If a value is found, it is treated as a JSON-formatted value like
              parameters embedded in the "class" attribute, though outer curly
              braces are optional.
              However, if the <a href='#config-option-evalAttr'>"evalAttr" configuration property</a>
              is <em>false</em>, then the attribute value as a whole is taken to be
              the parameter value, with the name being derived from the attribute name.
              For attribute names beginning with the prefix "data-", wallflower strips
              that prefix to form the parameter name.
              <p>
              Again, as with parameter values embedded in the "class", feature names
              can be used to group parameters when clarification is necessary.

              The last source of parameters that wallflower can use is a <em>script</em>
              element contained by the affected element.
              The markup looks like this:
              <code>
                &lt;div class='affected-by-wallflower'&gt;
                  &lt;script type='text/plain'&gt;
                    parameter_1: 100,
                    parameter_2: "something",
                    parameter_3: "something else"
                  &lt;/script&gt;
              </code>
              By marking the script element with a type of "text/plain", the browser is
              informed that no attempt should be made to execute the script as code.
