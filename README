Wallflower 0.3 README

There's not much to this at the moment; as it's
just a jQuery plugin, there's no "installation"
as such; just use it by gluing it into your
own build or directly importing it into a page.

0.3 Note: my "versioning" scheme is totally ad-hoc
at the moment. There's not really any meaning to
"0.3" but it's the version I've been maintaining
lately. I should probably just get rid of the older
versions.


Files:

* wallflower-0.3.js - the plugin

Other files:

* index.html - rudimentary page with links to
    the source and a demo/test page
* jqui - jQuery UI stuff for the test - ignore
    this for your own project
* wallflower-fragment.html - part of demo/test
* wallflower.html - part of demo/test
* wallflower-demo.js - part of demo/test - this
    is an example of using the plugin

More info:

There's a blog post at http://whatsthepointy.blogspot.com

Sometime soon I'll be getting this up at the jQuery plugin
site. That'll be the best place for documentation I think.

Documentation is in the "doc" directory, which is also
hosted at:
