Wallflower 0.1 README

There's not much to this at the moment; as it's
just a jQuery plugin, there's no "installation"
as such; just use it by gluing it into your
own build or directly importing it into a page.

Files:

* wallflower-0.1.js - the plugin

Other files:

* index.html - rudimentary page with links to
    the source and a demo/test page
* jqui - jQuery UI stuff for the test - ignore
    this for your own project
* wallflower-fragment.html - part of demo/test
* wallflower.html - part of demo/test
